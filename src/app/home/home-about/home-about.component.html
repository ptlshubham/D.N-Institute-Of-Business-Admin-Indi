                        "Education is the great enabler that allows individual to unlock their
                        potential”. Literacy skills are more critical today than ever before, and they will become even

                        It has emerged from Shri V.Z. Patel Commerce College and now separated from it. Shri V. Z. Patel
                        Commerce College located at Anand, was established in the year 1997. It is affiliated to Sardar
                        Patel University, Vallabh Vidyanagar. The College has started its first course of B.Com. in the
                        same year 1997 with the enrollment of 98 students. The success of B.Com inspired us to carry
                        forward the torch of enlightening the students and offering them a chance to study for the
                        degree of<b> Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA – General)</b> which was started in the year 2005
                        with the enrollment of 72 students. It was a great honour for the college to achieve 100 percent
                        result in Sardar Patel University through the first batch of BBA Students in the year 2008-2009.
